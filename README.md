# CaSudoku

CaSudoku began as coursework for my Advanced Web Design Techniques class, it has now developed in to a project for me to experiment
with different JavaScript techniques. Built using HTML5 Canvas and Web Workers.

The latest versions of [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome), [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.firefox.com/) or [Apple Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) are recommended for the best experience.

Uses [kudoku](http://attractivechaos.github.com/plb/kudoku.js) sudoku solver to generate new puzzles.
